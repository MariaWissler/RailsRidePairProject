# Rideshare Rails
## What We're Looking For

<!-- Describe the types of entity relationships you set up in your project and why you set up the relationships that way:
Driver - Trip: One to many
Passenger - Trip: One to many

Describe the role of model validations in your application:
Prevents db from saving invalid data. May mention user experience.

All other questions are qualitative. We explicitly do not need to check their Trello boards... there's currently not an easy way that we can get permissions to their boards/not worth it. Check their Heroku app deployment! (Grade against it, if possible)
 -->
