# RailsRidePairProject

Hello there ! 

In this project we built a website to model a small community ridesharing app thought Pair Programing 

There will be two main pieces of functionality:

- New passengers and drivers can sign up for the service and review their information
- Passengers can request and rate trips, and drivers can see their aggregated statistics
- This project was meant to be exploratory, and it can still be develop, I personally enjoyed the complexity to create the database, get more attention to detail in user views and learn how to deploy ! 

The project can be seen here : https://hanria-ridehsare.herokuapp.com/
